 *
 * The voice-activity detector is an energy gate, and energy is a fact about the

 * gap, so "what's the weather in — " *pause* " — London" is two segments, two
 * transcripts and, before this, two turns: the first one asking the model a
 * truncated question, the second arriving as a bare noun with no question left
 * to attach it to. People pause. They pause to think of the word, to look at
 * something, mid-list, before the important part. An assistant that treats the
 * first gap as the end of the thought is one you have to talk to carefully, and
 * having to talk carefully is the whole failure.
 *
 * So the segment is no longer the turn. Transcripts accumulate here, and the
 * turn fires only when the text looks finished AND the room has gone quiet.
 *
 * Crucially this costs nothing in the common case. A complete sentence with no
 * one speaking fires immediately — `holdFor` returns 0 — so the latency of an
 * ordinary question is exactly what it was. The waiting only happens when there
 * is a reason to wait.
